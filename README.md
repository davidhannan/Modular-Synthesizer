# Modular-Synthesizer

A DIY modular synthesizer.

Made from module circuit designs found from various places online.

Mainly from <a href="https://www.eddybergman.com/">Eddy Bergman's</a> website.

Panel designs made by me in fusion 360 for my 2"x8" module format.
Panels are made from 2"x8" aluminum flat bar blanks.

Empty VCO Panels:

A brushed aluminum finish is achieved by sanding in a jig to ensure uniform sanding direction. An acrylic spray sealant is then applied.
